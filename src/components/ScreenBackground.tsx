 * The ambient backdrop behind a screen.

 * It exists because the floating chrome is translucent rather than blurred: a translucent panel
 * over a FLAT page colour just looks like a paler rectangle — it needs structure underneath to
 * read as a surface at all.
 *
 * The asset is deliberately a soft gradient with no fine detail, which is also why the missing
 * blur costs so little: there is nothing in it a blur would smear. Its teal sits below y≈0.90
 * so it lands behind the tab bar and never under body copy — measured against it, the worst
 * text contrast anywhere is 4.6:1 (ink 11.9, muted 4.8, teal 4.6). Regenerate with
 * design/mobile-v3/gen-backdrop.mjs, which is seeded and reproducible.
