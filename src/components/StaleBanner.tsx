// US-X1 · shown ABOVE cached rows when the refresh behind them failed.

// The counterpart to LoadStateView, and the reason its offline copy could stop lying. A
// cache-first screen has two states a full-screen view cannot express:
//
//   nothing cached, request failed  -> LoadStateView: "You're offline. We couldn't reach
//                                      the server." Nothing is shown, and nothing is claimed.
//   cached rows, refresh failed     -> the rows, with THIS above them. Something IS shown,
//                                      so the honest thing is to say how old it is.
//
// ⚠️ It is not optional dressing. Rows with no marker read as current — which on this app
// means a rescuer looking at a stray report that may already have been claimed, or a list of
// volunteer shifts that may already be full. The whole value of a cache is that stale data
// beats no data; the whole risk is that stale data looks like fresh data.
