// US-O1 · the ONE offline/error/empty state, shared.
//
// §13.3 asks that a screen degrade gracefully rather than fail. `client.ts` has returned a
// `status: 0` network sentinel since Sprint 6, but no screen distinguished it from a 500 —
// so an offline person saw "something went wrong", which is untrue and unactionable.
//
// This is deliberately ONE component rather than a state per screen. The plan's own words:
// "One shared component, not 85 bespoke states." A per-screen version drifts, and the
// screens that get it wrong are always the rarely-seen ones — which is exactly where a
// confusing empty state does the most damage.
