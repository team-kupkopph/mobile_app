// Review step 7a (MQ10) · the community guidelines and, once counsel has written it, the Terms of Use.
//
// ⚠️ TWO DIFFERENT THINGS LIVE HERE, and only one is written.
//
//  · COMMUNITY_GUIDELINES is product policy, in plain words: what may not be posted, what happens if it is, how to report and block.
//    Google Play's UGC policy asks for terms that "define objectionable content"; Apple 1.2 expects the developer's own rules to say
//    the same. This is the part engineering can write, and it is real: a moderator's takedown reasons (moderation/notices.py) are these
//    same categories.
//
//  · TERMS_OF_USE is the LEGAL document (liability, governing law, the licence over what people post, the waiver). That is the owner's
//    and Philippine counsel's (launch gate 6). It is `null` until they hand it over, and the screen then says "Community guidelines",
//    not "Terms", rather than present guidelines as a legal agreement nobody has reviewed. When it is written: paste it here as
//    sections, bump TERMS_VERSION (here in consent.ts and backend config/settings.py), and set TERMS_ENFORCED=1.
