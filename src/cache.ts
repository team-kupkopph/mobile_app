/**
 * US-X1 · a small typed read cache with per-key TTL (Sprint 7's US-O2, D-S7-4).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT React Query. The need is "show the last answer while the new one loads,
 * and survive a dead connection" on a handful of feeds — not a data layer. A migration would
 * touch every screen Track R just finished touching.
 *
 * ⚠️ SEQUENCING, AND WHY THIS COULD NOT HAVE SHIPPED EARLIER. Caching a screen that cannot
 * tell a failure from an empty result means caching the wrong answer and then showing it
 * confidently for a TTL. The rescue map's "No strays reported near Marikina right now" would
 * have become a *persisted* claim. That is why US-X1 was sequenced after Track R.
 *
 * ══ §12.5 — WHAT MAY GO ON DISK ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The rule is: never a precise coordinate, never another person's contact details. Two design
 * choices carry it, and both are about what happens when someone adds an endpoint later.
 *
 *   1. AN ALLOWLIST, NOT A DENYLIST. A new endpoint is uncached until somebody decides
 *      otherwise. With a denylist the default is "cached", and the failure is silent — the
 *      data is on disk before anyone notices it should not be.
 *
 *   2. EXACT PATHS, NEVER PREFIXES, and this is the specific trap here: `/reports/map` is
 *      coarsened to a ~500m grid and is safe, while `/reports/{id}` returns `precise_location`
 *      to the reporter and the active claimer (US-SEC1). A `startsWith("/reports")` allowlist
 *      — the obvious implementation — would write the real location of an animal, and the
 *      home of whoever reported it, to unencrypted disk. The two paths differ by one segment.
 *
 * `/me` is deliberately absent even though it is the most-fetched endpoint in the app. It
 * carries the account's phone number, and caching identity is how a screen ends up showing a
 * stale verification badge — the exact failure US-R1 fixed on ProfileScreen.
 */
/**
 * ⚠️ RESOLVED LAZILY, INSIDE A try/catch, AND THAT IS NOT DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING FOR ITS OWN
 * SAKE — a plain top-level import of this module BRICKED THE APP.
 *
 * AsyncStorage throws `NativeModule: AsyncStorage is null` at MODULE LOAD when its native
 * side is not linked into the binary. Not on first use — on import. So every try/catch in
 * this file was useless against it: the app died at startup with a red screen before any of
 * them could run, on the welcome screen, for a feature nothing had asked for yet.
 *
 * That is exactly the hazard `app.config.ts` documents with `runtimeVersion: appVersion`:
 * JS that calls into native code the binary lacks. The runtimeVersion policy stops an OTA
 * from CAUSING it; this stops it from being fatal if it happens anyway — a missing native
 * module now costs the cache, not the app.
 *
 * `undefined` = not yet resolved, `null` = resolved and unavailable. The distinction is what
 * keeps this to one require attempt rather than one per call.
