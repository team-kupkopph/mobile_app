/**
 * The landing screen — rebuilt 2026-09-05 to be lighter and to lay itself out.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT CHANGED STRUCTURALLY, AND WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN THE LOOK.
 *
 * Every element used to be absolutely positioned on a 540×1170 canvas, scaled with sx()/sy()
 * so the build matched `screens/user/gen-screens.js` pixel for pixel. That is a faithful way
 * to ship a mockup and a poor way to ship an app:
 *
 *   - Text could not reflow. Copy was pinned at a y-coordinate, so a longer line, a
 *     translation, or the largest dynamic-type setting overlapped the row beneath it rather
 *     than pushing it down. **US-W1's "largest dynamic type clips nothing" was unachievable
 *     on this screen by construction**, which is worth more than the visual refresh.
 *   - Spacing was arithmetic. The comment block that used to live here derived GUEST_TOP 888
 *     from "806 + 68 = 874", and every copy change re-opened that sum. Flex `gap` states the
 *     same intent in a way that cannot drift.
 *
 * The 44 pt lesson that produced those constants is NOT discarded — it is the reason the
 * action stack below uses a real `gap` and explicit `minHeight`s. Stacked controls need
 * SPACING; `hitSlop` only works when there is empty space to claim, and at ~27 pt apart the
 * old links' slop would have overlapped, letting the topmost sibling silently win a
 * contested tap. See `touch.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️ The fake status bar (a hard-coded "9:41" and a drawn battery) is gone. It existed
 * because App.tsx sets `<StatusBar hidden />` and the mockup drew one. Shipping a fake clock
 * to real users is a mockup artefact, not a feature; the real inset does the job.
 *
 * ⚠️ "Browse as a guest" is now a prominent TEXT button rather than a third white box, and
 * that touches a recorded decision, so: the note in gen-screens.js says it must be
 * "prominent, not buried — the friend-shared-a-stray-link visitor should see this
 * immediately", and it was made a box because it had shipped as an 18 pt line of text that
 * was almost unpressable. Both concerns are still met — it is teal, weight 700, directly
 * under the primary actions, and carries an explicit 48 pt target. What it no longer does is
 * make three stacked boxes compete for the same glance.
