/**
 * Screens take their text sizes from the ramp, not from raw numbers.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS GUARD MEASURES, AND WHY IT IS NOT A `fontSize` COUNT. A ramp step is four
 * properties — `{fontSize, fontWeight, letterSpacing, lineHeight}` — so a style is only on the
 * ramp when all four RENDER the same. React Native's defaults matter here and are easy to get
 * wrong by reading source: an absent `fontWeight` IS "400", an absent `letterSpacing` IS 0, and
 * "bold" IS "700". Comparing style objects as text rather than as rendered values is how an
 * earlier pass of this migration reported "0 of 839 already conform" when the real figure was
 * 41 — and how the plan projected 317 bindable sites by counting `fontSize` alone.
 *
 * So this resolves each style object the way RN would, then asks whether the result equals a
 * step. `typography` is IMPORTED rather than copied, so correcting the ramp moves the guard
 * with it instead of leaving a stale duplicate to disagree with the token.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO STEPS SUPPLY SIZE ONLY. The canvas declares `17 / 700-800` and `13 / 400-800` — a
 * range — so `subtitle` and `meta` name no weight and the caller brings one:
 *     { ...typography.meta, fontWeight: "800" }
 * A binding that drops that trailing weight silently de-bolds the text, which is the exact
 * regression this whole track was paused to avoid. Openness is read off the token (a step with
 * no `fontWeight` is open), never hardcoded here.
 *
 * This is a RATCHET in the shape of themeAdoption.test.ts: exact conformance is a flat rule at
 * zero, and the remaining off-ramp sizes may fall but never rise.

 * ⚠️ THIS NUMBER IS THE REMAINING WORK, NOT A BUDGET. 876 style objects held a literal

 * (712 less Avatar's two `fontSize: Math.round(size * 0.33)`, a size computed from a prop,
 * which no fixed ramp can hold). T2 then snapped the 221 where the SIZE IS THE ONLY THING
 * THAT MOVES — 16→17 x83, 14→13 x77, 12→13 x49, and four half-point strays. (49, not 50:
 * the tab label is held back deliberately — see the exemption below.)
 *
 * What is left is not more of the same, and should not be described as "the rest of the 1pt
 * band". It is three groups, each carrying a decision rather than a delta:
 *
 *   · 259 sit within 1pt of a step but would ALSO gain the step's tracking, lose an explicit
 *     line height, or change weight. The largest are 22→title x46 and 20/18→section x43,
 *     which snap 1pt AND adopt tracking the screens never had.
 *   · 167 are ALREADY the right size and differ only in the other three properties. 88 of
 *     these are 15pt at weight 600/700/800 — and `body`, the only 15pt step, is closed at
 *     400. THE RAMP HAS NO BOLD FIFTEEN. Binding them would de-bold 88 sites, which is the
 *     regression the ramp was un-pinned to prevent.
 *   · 60 are further than 1pt away — 58 of them 30pt, the app's most common heading size,
 *     for which the canvas declares no step at all. That is T3.
 *
 * It may fall. It may not rise: a new screen typing `fontSize: 14` is the drift the ramp
 * exists to end.
 *
 * 424, DOWN FROM 493, AND THE BOLD FIFTEEN IS NO LONGER A FINDING — IT IS A STEP. From T2
 * onward every track counted the 15 pt labels and small buttons at 700–800 that the ramp had
 * no home for, and refused to disguise them as `body`; by the Adopt deck the count was 93.
 * The canvas's own artboards drew that size nine times against four uses of body, so the
 * panel was the incomplete party. It now declares "Label, small button | 15 / 700-800",
 * `typography.strong` is its token, and the 69 sites that render exactly as it describes
 * are bound with no pixel change. The 24 that remain at fifteen are the 600s — one weight
 * short of the declared range — and the ones carrying a line height; both are decisions
 * of their own, not drift the step can absorb.
 *
 * 411, DOWN FROM 424 — T3, AND WHAT T3 TURNED OUT NOT TO BE. The plan called 30 pt "the app's
 * most common heading size (54 uses)" and framed a decision: a display step above 27, or
 * move the sites. Read by what the text IS rather than what size it wears, 45 of the 54 are
 * `backGlyph` — the "‹" back chevron drawn as text on the screens that have not adopted
 * BackButton. That is screenHeader.test.ts's enumerated remainder, a header migration its
 * own header warns about, and no ramp step was ever going to describe it. Four more are
 * glyphs too (a "›", avatar initials, step and quantity numerals). The thirteen real
 * headings moved: five screen titles to `display` (27) and eight hero lines — confirmation
 * screens and the pet's name on Listing Detail — to `hero` (25). The name was the one call:
 * the panel's "Subject name" is 21, but on that screen the name IS the hero line, and the
 * deck card draws it at hero; −5 pt rather than −9.
 *
 * 293, DOWN FROM 411, IN THREE MOVES THAT ADD UP EXACTLY (35 + 50 + 33 = 118):
 *   · 35 zero-change binds unlocked by correcting T1's rule for open steps. `strong`, `meta`
 *     and `subtitle` name no tracking and no leading, so a spread overrides neither — an
 *     explicit `lineHeight: 21` beside `...typography.meta` renders exactly as the literal
 *     did. T1 had treated it as a side effect. Only the declared weight range is checked.
 *   · 50 one-point snaps the same correction turned into pure size moves — T2's "size plus
 *     leading" leftovers: 14→13 x31, 12→13 x18, 12.5→13 x1, every extra property kept.
 *   · 33 fifteens: 22 at weight 600 — one step outside the range the canvas declares and a
 *     weight its artboards never draw at fifteen, twelve of them inline field errors —
 *     moved to 700 and onto `strong`; 11 body-copy sites at 400 without body's designed
 *     line height moved onto `body`, gaining its 21.
 * What remains at fifteen is in JSX, not in a style: the ladder's step title sets its weight
 * per state inline, including a 600 for steps not yet reached, as the artboard draws it.
 *
 * 213, DOWN FROM 293, BY DELETION: the 44 hand-rolled headers went to ScreenHeader, taking
 * their 30 pt "‹" glyph style and their own title style with them. Neither was ever going to
 * bind to a step — a chevron is not text and a hand-rolled title is what the primitive
 * replaces — so this is the count shrinking because the drift was removed, not absorbed.
 *
 * 126, DOWN FROM 213 — THE HEADINGS ADOPT THE PANEL'S TRACKING, AND THAT IS ALL THEY ADOPT.
 * Read by name, the "size plus something else" group was never one thing. 83 sites are
 * headings, titles and names at weight 800 that differed from their step only in tracking
 * (the panel's -0.3 to -0.6, which every artboard draws and no screen had) and by at most a
 * point of size (23 -> 21 twice). They are bound; the weight is unchanged at every one, and an
 * explicit line height is kept, because no heading step names one. Three more were dead
 * `headerTitle` styles the header conversion orphaned, deleted. What is left is, by name,
 * and adds up (28 + 2 + 43 + 20 + 13 + 10 + 7 + 3 = 126):
 *   · (Since resolved to the 2 inputs.) 28 hand-rolled button labels at 18-22 / 700 (`submitText`,
 *     `primaryText`, `primaryLabel`...) and 2 text inputs at 18 / 700. The panel's button and field row is
 *     17 / 700-800 and `Button` and `Field` already bind to it, so these are buttons and
 *     fields not on the primitive — the header story's shape, not the ramp's.
 *   · 43 glyphs drawn as text — the six ShelterVolunteer "‹" (screenHeader.test.ts's
 *     remainder, since resolved) and ScreenHeader's own, "›" chevrons, hearts, medals, avatar
 *     initials, OTP digits — no step is for.
 *   · 20 small text sites at 10-11 / 400-700 — captions and footnotes below `meta`, which
 *     the ramp's only 11 pt step (`label`, 800 / +0.8 / upper) does not describe. The tab
 *     label is one of them, at the canvas's own 11 / 600 / +0.1.
 *   · 13 body-copy sites at 16-17 / 400 with a line height — body copy one size above
 *     `body`, a call the `body` step's 21 pt leading would also change.
 *   · 10 half-point strays (14.5, 15.5).
 *   · 7 large numerals (`statValue`, `feeValue`, `impactTotals`...) that the canvas never
 *     draws at all, so there is no evidence to snap them to.
 *   · 3 value labels at 18 / 700 (`recipientEmail`, `docName`, `fileName`).
 * 92, DOWN FROM 96: the four gated buttons (AdjustPin, ListingDetail, PlaceRequest x2) are
 * `Button` now, each with an honest state instead of a grey one — see buttonAdoption.test.ts.
 *
 * 96, DOWN FROM 102: the last six hand-rolled headers — the ShelterVolunteer screens — went to
 * ScreenHeader, and their six 30 pt "‹" glyphs with them. The header ratchet is at zero.
 *
 * ScreenHeader's title is not among them: the one header the canvas draws sets it at
 * 17 / 800 / -0.2, and the primitive now does too, measured on the device (12 pt cap height,
 * SF Bold at 17). US-CH2's 22 had no artboard behind it.
 *
 * 102, DOWN FROM 126, BY DELETION AGAIN: 45 hand-rolled full-width CTAs — flat teal pills at
 * 54–60 with their own 18–22 / 700 label — became `<Button>`, the canvas's gradient pill with
 * the panel's 17 / 800 label, and took 24 of the 28 off-ramp labels with them. The four that
 * stay are the four buttons `Button` cannot yet be: AdjustPin's Save (`disabled={!ready}`
 * until the map settles), ListingDetail's Inquire (disabled once sent) and PlaceRequest's
 * Accept and Decline (disabled once decided). Each is a real "not possible now" state, not a
 * validation gate, and `Button` has no `disabled` on purpose — a decision for that primitive,
 * not a bind. The 2 inputs at 18 / 700 are a Field adoption of the same shape.
 *
 * ZERO, AND A FLAT RULE FROM HERE. The 92 were seven kinds, and each got its answer:
 *   · 20 small captions at 10–11 — the panel now declares the eleven-point caption the
 *     artboards were already drawing (library #12: "Caption, tab label, badge | 11 /
 *     600-800"), `typography.caption` is its token, and the nine at 400 moved to 600 because
 *     the artboards never draw an eleven lighter than that. The two uppercase field labels
 *     went to `label`, which is what they were.
 *   · 13 body-copy sites at 16–17 / 400 — the artboards never draw body copy above 15;
 *     `body`, gaining its 21 pt leading. The one 16 / 600 note is `strong`.
 *   · 10 half-point strays — `strong` or `body` by T2's own rule.
 *   · 7 large numerals — the heading step of their size, the #70 decision applied to the
 *     one text it had skipped for want of evidence; a stat's number IS its heading.
 *   · 5 at 18 / 700 — two inputs and three file/name labels — `subtitle` at 700, the panel's
