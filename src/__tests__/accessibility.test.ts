// WHY A SOURCE SCAN RATHER THAN RENDERED ASSERTIONS. React Native already derives an
// accessibility label from a touchable's child `<Text>`, so a button reading "Send report" is
// announced correctly with no extra props. The real gap — and the one this project actually
// had — is **icon-only controls**: a floating circle whose only content is a "‹" glyph is
// announced as nothing, or as "left single quotation mark". That was the primary way back out
// of 49 screens.
//
// A renderer-based test would cover a handful of screens deeply. This covers EVERY screen for
// the one defect that matters, needs no new dependency, and cannot rot: a new icon-only
// button without a label fails here the moment it is written.

// ── US-W1 · an action nested inside an accessible container must be reachable ────────
//
// iOS FLATTENS an accessible container into a single element. So a card that carries
// `accessibilityRole="button"` and contains a second tappable thing does not present two
// actions to VoiceOver — it presents one, and the inner action is not merely awkward to
// reach, it is ABSENT. On the Kawang-Gawa schedule that was the Cancel link: a volunteer
// using a screen reader could open a shift and had no way to cancel one.
//
// `labelled ≠ navigable` is the whole point of US-W1, and this is the one part of it a
// machine can check. It cannot tell you whether the reading order makes sense or whether a
// modal traps focus — a person still has to walk it.
//
// ⚠️ THIS SCAN MISSED THE ONE SITE IT WAS WRITTEN FOR, TWICE, BEFORE IT WORKED.
//   1. It matched only literal <TouchableOpacity>; the real site nests <CancelLink/>, a
//      custom component. Fixed by looking for a nested `onPress` rather than a nested tag.
//   2. It found the tag's closing `>` with indexOf, which stops at the `>` inside
//      `onPress={() => nav()}` — truncating the attributes before `accessibilityLabel`, so
//      the container read as non-accessible and the site was skipped. NEVER REGEX JSX; the
//      tag end has to be found at brace depth 0.
// Both times the scan reported ZERO and looked like good news.
