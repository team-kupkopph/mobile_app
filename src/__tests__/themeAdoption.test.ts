 * counted 77 distinct hex literals across 1,117 occurrences — and it says plainly of itself:
 * "NO SCREEN IS CONVERTED BY THIS FILE." For a whole sprint that stayed true. The design audit
 * against the approved canvas measured the result: 41 screens still declaring their own
 * `const colors`, against 31 importing the theme.
 *
 * This guard is a RATCHET, like the header one. It fails if the count goes UP — a new screen
 * copy-pasting a palette — and also if it falls without the number here being updated, so
 * finishing the job is recorded rather than silently absorbed.
