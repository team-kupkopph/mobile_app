/**
 * US-CH2 · one ScreenHeader, one BackButton, and a ratchet on the rest.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE NUMBER THIS FILE EXISTS TO HOLD DOWN. Before this story the app drew 59 hand-rolled
 * headers. Forty-five of them opened with `paddingTop: 58` and four with `64` — a magic number
 * tuned to one device's notch. NONE of the 59 called useSafeAreaInsets, and none used a
 * SafeAreaView. That is not a style complaint: the V2 pass shipped a Home whose greeting sat
 * under the Dynamic Island for a full release for exactly this reason, and this sprint found
 * the same shape again in three screens' failure branches (issue #38).
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS STORY DID NOT CONVERT ALL 59, AND SAYS SO RATHER THAN IMPLYING OTHERWISE. The plan
 * opens by warning that "convert the rest" is the story that has already burned this project.
 * What landed is the two shared auth headers (15 screens from one file) and the 8 hand-rolled
 * screens an e2e flow actually walks — the ones a conversion can be checked against. The
 * remaining 51 are enumerated below BY NAME, and the ratchet makes sure that list only ever
 * gets shorter.

// 51 -> 50: MyInquiriesScreen moved to ScreenHeader when its list was extracted so
// Adopt's segmented control could render the same list in place.
//
// 50 -> 6: the conversion this file's header warned about, done the way the warning asked —
// mechanically where the shape was mechanical, and by name where it was not. Forty screens
// drew the identical header (a styles.header row, a goBack chevron, a title beside it,
// nothing else) and were converted by a codemod that refused any other shape. Three
// carried a right-side action and one had a bare Text for its back control — those four by
// hand, the action moving into ScreenHeader's `right`. Checked on device for the thing that
// burned this project: the title now clears the Dynamic Island on every converted screen,
// because ScreenHeader pads by the inset rather than 58.
//
// The six that remain are the ShelterVolunteer screens whose `styles.header` View wraps far
// more than a header — a stats block, a calendar strip, a contact card. Converting them is a
// layout change, not a header swap, and is not disguised as one:
//   ShelterVolunteerActivityScreen, ShelterVolunteerAttendanceScreen,
//   ShelterVolunteerCalendarScreen, ShelterVolunteerCancelScreen,
//   ShelterVolunteerDetailScreen, ShelterVolunteerRequestsScreen.
