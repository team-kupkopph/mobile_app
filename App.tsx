// at this level and nothing a developer needs to see. Keeping every other warning
// unmuted so a genuine yellow-box still surfaces. Dev-only; releases have LogBox off
// entirely per the RN default. Fixes the ergonomic issue where the yellow banner
// overlapped the F19 dev chip on SignupWall and other bottom-of-screen affordances
