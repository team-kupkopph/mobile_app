# E2E smoke on the money paths (US-X2)

Maestro flows over the paths the app exists for. **Pre-release, not per-PR** (§15.4) —
these drive a real simulator against a real backend and take minutes, and a suite that makes
every PR slow is a suite people learn to skip.

## What is actually covered

| Flow | Path | Runs unattended |
|---|---|---|
| `10-report-a-stray.yaml` | file a report → it appears in My Reports | ✅ |
| `20-browse-and-inquire.yaml` | browse adoptable animals → inquire | ✅ |
| `30-volunteer-signup.yaml` | shift → waiver + contact consent → requested | ✅ |
| `15-owner-profile.yaml` | "You" tab → the owner's profile | ✅ |
| `50-shelter-shell.yaml` | shelter sign-in → dashboard ⇄ shelter profile | ✅ |
| `40-signup-needs-a-human.yaml` | signup → email code → home | ❌ — one value is typed by a person |

### Why the last two exist

`ProfileScreen`, `ShelterDashboardScreen` and `ShelterProfileScreen` sit behind a sign-in, so
for three sprints they were "verified by reading the diff" and a person had to be asked to log
in each time it mattered. Asking a human to be the test harness does not scale and does not
repeat. These flows do the same walk from environment variables, the same way, every run —
which is the whole argument for US-X2 in one example.

`50-shelter-shell.yaml` also asserts something no one thought to check by hand: the stack's
`initialRouteName` is always `home`, so a returning shelter account lands on the OWNER home
screen and `HomeScreen` resets it to the shelter shell after reading `/me`. If that redirect
breaks, a shelter admin opens the app into someone else's product.

`00-signin.yaml` is a subroutine the others call, not a path of its own. `50-shelter-shell`
calls it with **different** credentials via `runFlow.env`, which is why its landing assertion
is `screen.home` — the one post-login state an owner and a shelter genuinely share.

## Why signup can't run unattended

It needs the 6-digit code, and there is deliberately no way for a test to read one.
`ConsoleSender` prints it to stdout and keeps it **out of the logging system entirely**,
because §12.6 requires that CloudWatch read access must not double as "sign in as any user".
That is a good rule and this suite is not a reason to weaken it.

So `MAESTRO_OTP` is supplied by whoever runs the flow, read from the dev server's stdout.

**What would make it autonomous** — and what is deliberately *not* in this repo: a dev-only
fixed code for a single throwaway `.invalid` domain, behind three independent guards (`DEBUG`;
both settings explicitly present so no default config enables it; the domain required to end
in `.invalid`, so a typo pointing it at a real domain is refused loudly). The shape matters:
a "give me the code" endpoint whose guard fails in production hands out the live OTP for
**any** address, whereas a fixed code whose guard fails affects only a domain nobody can
register and no mail can reach. That is still an authentication bypass in the backend, it
needs the owner's explicit sign-off, and it was not added unilaterally.

Every other flow sidesteps it entirely: **sign-in needs no code.**

## Setup

Maestro is not currently installed on this machine.

```bash
curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash
```

Then build and install the app on a booted simulator once:

```bash
cd mobile_app && npx expo run:ios
```

## Credentials

**Nothing in this repository should ever contain a real credential.** The flows read them
from the environment, and `e2eSelectors.test.ts` fails the build if a literal address or
password appears in a flow file.

`MAESTRO_EMAIL` / `MAESTRO_PASSWORD` belong to a **throwaway account on a dev or staging
backend** — never a real user's, and never a production account.

Create or refresh both fixtures with the accounts, capabilities and shelter profile the flows
need — the owner's Verified Member standing included, without which the inquiry is correctly
refused:

```bash
cd backend && eval "$(DJANGO_DEBUG=1 .venv/bin/python dev/e2e_fixtures.py)"
```

It refuses to run outside `DEBUG`, refuses any address that is not `.invalid`, and generates
new passwords every run.

```bash
cd mobile_app && \
  MAESTRO_EMAIL=... MAESTRO_PASSWORD=... \
  MAESTRO_SHELTER_EMAIL=... MAESTRO_SHELTER_PASSWORD=... \
  maestro test e2e/
```

⚠️ **Two accounts, not one.** `MAESTRO_SHELTER_*` must be an account whose `account_type` is
`shelter` — the shelter shell is unreachable otherwise, and the owner credentials cannot get
there no matter what they tap.

The signup flow additionally needs a fresh address each run (signup deliberately reports
"this email already has an account" — the one place enumeration is allowed):

```bash
MAESTRO_SIGNUP_EMAIL="smoke+$(date +%s)@e2e.invalid" \
MAESTRO_SIGNUP_PASSWORD=... \
MAESTRO_OTP=123456 \
  maestro test e2e/flows/40-signup-needs-a-human.yaml
```

## Environment the flows need

Learned by running them, each one a real failure first:

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| `clearKeychain` before launch | tokens live in SecureStore (the iOS keychain), which `clearState` does **not** wipe — the app relaunched still signed in |
| `location: inuse` permission | the report flow's submit is gated on a GPS fix; without the grant it waits forever on a dialog no assertion mentions. `allow` is rejected for location specifically |
| a simulated location | `xcrun simctl location <udid> set 14.6507,121.1029` — permission alone gives no fix |
| an account that can inquire | the adoption inquiry is gated on Verified Member + verified phone (US-A3/A4). A bare account is correctly refused, so the fixture needs the same standing a real adopter has |
| ⚠️ **never poll the login endpoint to see if the throttle cleared** | each probe is itself a login attempt against the same IP limit, so the loop keeps the lockout alive indefinitely. Wait passively |
| ⚠️ **login is rate-limited BY IP** | running the sign-in repeatedly trips `LoginIpThrottle` (HTTP 429, ~30 min) and then **every** account from that machine is refused — a fresh fixture does not dodge it. This is the backend working; space the runs out |

## Seed requirements

`20-browse-and-inquire` needs at least one listing and `30-volunteer-signup` at least one open
shift. If the seed is empty they fail on a missing `card.adopt.0` / `card.kawanggawa.0` —
**which is the correct outcome.** A flow that skips itself when its fixture is empty is the
same green-but-checked-nothing failure US-G1 was written about.

## ⚠️ Text assertions: plain ASCII only

Learned across three failed attempts on one assertion. **Every text assertion that failed
contained a non-alphanumeric character; every one that passed was plain ASCII words.**

| assertion | result |
|---|---|
| `"Inquiry sent"`, `"Back to home"`, `"No strays reported near"` | matched |
| `"You're offline"` (apostrophe) | **failed against a screen displaying exactly that** |
| `"Dog · Injured"` (middle dot) | **failed against a screen displaying exactly that** |

Both failures were verified by screenshot and by comparing the bytes — the app and the flow
held the identical character. Whatever the cause, the lesson is the same one this suite is
built on: **assert an id.** Text assertions are reserved for the one case that genuinely needs
literal copy — the forbidden empty state in the offline walk — and even there the accompanying
positive assertion is by id.

## Selectors, and why they aren't text

Flows match on `testID`, not on visible copy. Maestro can match text and every tutorial does,
but Track R rewrote user-facing copy across 42 screens in one sprint — a suite pinned to copy
fails on every wording change until someone deletes it. The id is a contract between the app
and the flows; the copy stays free to improve.

Naming: `screen.<route>` (matching the `Stack.Screen` name exactly), `btn.<screen>.<action>`,
`field.<screen>.<name>`, `chk.<screen>.<name>`, `card.<list>.<index>`, `tab.<key>` for the
owner shell and `tab.shelter.<key>` for the shelter one.

## What guards this between releases

`src/__tests__/e2eSelectors.test.ts` runs in the normal unit suite, in milliseconds, with no
simulator. It checks that every selector a flow references exists in the app, that screen
anchors match real routes, and that no credential is committed.

⚠️ **It does not prove the flows pass.** It proves the flows and the app have not drifted
apart — the single most common way a pre-release suite rots into a pile of failures on ship
day. "The selectors are wired" is the claim; "E2E is covered" is not.
